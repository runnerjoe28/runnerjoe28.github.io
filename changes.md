# Description of Starting Template

The template used was created with Bootstrap [here](https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/). It is a dynamic personal website.

# Description of Changes

The changes listed here are outside of merely replacing the information in the template with my own. The template is designed for "freelancers, graphic designers, illustrators, photographers" plus others of course.

## Sections Removed

Removed the following sections and associated links

- Contact: Contact info is already on sidebar and in other places, also deleted the form folder
- Testimonials: I don't have any
- Services: I don't have any (yet)
- Facts: felt it didn't really provide any value

## Other Changes

- Changed skills section to be image based, made 4 column setup
- Include actual resume link
- Added alt text to website images
- Change portfolio page to projects (and all verbiage and CSS classes)
- Group project pages into folders for easier access
- Change project images to include titles, descriptions, and only a link on the homepage
- Outside the pictures of me, all the other ones weren't flexible for new images, so I fixed those
