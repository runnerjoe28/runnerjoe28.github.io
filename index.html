        <p>Websites are pretty neat. I feel like the goal of all young coders is to build one. The sterotype of asking programmers to build an app/website further plays into this. I've been coding for I'd say long enough (nearly senior in college now) so I figured I'd start with making a static site with github pages. This quick writeup is mostly for something to fill the homepage if I'm being honest, but I hope I can expand both this website and associated github projects. Like everyone I have quite a few ideas for projects, we will see if I get around to any of them at this point.</p>
